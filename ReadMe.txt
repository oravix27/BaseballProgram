BaseballProgram

This is a personal project I made to track statistics for my brother's baseball team during their games in the 2023 season.
I enjoy using sports statistics to help me learn different ways to do things with programming.
I learned a lot about reading and writing to files when building this project.
My favorite part when builiding it was adding the dates to easily track when each statistic was tracked. 
It was fun to build, and fun for my brother to keep track with me.

I used Java for this project because it is the language I am most experienced with. For this upcoming season, I
am interested in using skills I learned to turn it into a web based application, to make it easier for others to access the data they need.

After compiling the java code, the program prompts the user to enter a name for the player. If the player exists, it looks up the file for that player.
If they don't exist, it creates a new file for the new player. It allows the user to enter stats, view stats, and delete stats. You can also modify it
directly because all data is stored in a CSV file.
